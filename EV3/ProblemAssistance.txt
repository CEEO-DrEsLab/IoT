If you find that you are coming across a problem, check here. I tried to collect all problems I encountered and how I resolved them.
If you come across a new problem and a solution let me know and I can add it here.

1. The terminal is saying my system time is incorrect. (can cause openSSH and certificate issues)
  A: Try resetting the system time and date to be local as it might have stopped for whatever reason and is out of date.
  You will need to use the command 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' . If the package dpkg-reconfigure is not found you will need 
  download it first. Type 'sudo apt-get install debconf' then the above command.
  
  If that doesn't fix the time, follow the instructions on this page: 
    https://wiki.debian.org/DateTime (Thank you, Caleb!)
    See this page for more information:
    https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/system-administrator/ch-sysadmin-time.html
    
  Now check your hardware clock's time to see if it had changed. To see your hardware clock's time, type 'hwclock --show' in your robot's
  terminal. If it still has not changed you can manually change it by typing 'hwclock --set --date="MM/DD/YYYY ##:##:##' with your
  current date and time.

2. My run_forever function isn't working. What do I do?
  A: I found a quirky fix for this. After you call run_forever on your motor, call 'time.wait()' (this function doesn't exist). Since the
    system will never find this function the motor will continue to run as it searches for the function but still allow new input and
    function calls. It will result in a http 500 server error saying this function doesn't exist. You can ignore it. The EV3 still runs
    fine. The problem is that the Python-language-bindings aren't updated as often as the ev3dev system is so they're a bit behind and
    some functions may break. This is the only case I've found so far. 
  
    You can see the wrapper function I wrote in appJSON.py in the EventServer folder where I implement this for my set_lm() function.

Long-Term IoT Goals
 - Make a web interface that people can use to select options (which creates a program for you) and which sends it automatically to your
 EV3/device (goal = user friendly, no SSH knowledge required)
 
 - Make a python back-end for ev3dev system so people can program directly in python and have it 'translated' to ev3dev functions, 
 variables, etc.; Use wrapper functions, perhaps modified, from EV3JSON.py in the EventServer file.
 
 - Remove SSHing and the terminal from user view
 
 - Digital daisy-chain of EV3s

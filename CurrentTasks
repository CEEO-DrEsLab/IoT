Summer goals
1. Connect Dan's front end interface to my back end code (○)
  - Also work on socket server (JSON?) to connect multiple ev3s
  - Status: Have to look into socket server
2. Connect IFTTT's front end interface to my back end code (◑)
  - Need interpreter
  - Status: Based on decisions from IFTTT group; when both sides meet in middle; front end still in development
3. Start on/Make an interpreter for other languages to Python (○)
  (so a program generates its own InterpretCommand function containing 
  all desired if... then... statements)
  - Must at least work for JSON
  - To receive the JSON data, need to make a socket server
  - Status: Researching, need self-writing code program that interprets another language and then writes a function in Python
4. Add to Google sites (☑)
  - Status: Put up a page and filled it out with current summary and information
5. Make a package list for classrooms. (☑)
  - Status: Prelim.; up for changes as suggested; should be nearly complete if not completely so


Long-Term IoT Goals
 - Make a web interface that people can use to select options (which creates a program for you) and which sends it automatically to your
 EV3 (goal = user friendly, no SSH knowledge required)
 
 - Make a python back-end for ev3dev system so people can program directly in python and have it 'translated' to ev3dev functions, 
 variables, etc.
 
 - Remove SSHing and the terminal from user view
 
 - Digital daisy-chain of EV3s

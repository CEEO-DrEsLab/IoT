If you find that you are coming across a problem, check here. I tried to collect all problems I encountered and how I resolved them.
If you come across a new problem and a solution let me know and I can add it here.

1. The terminal is saying my system time is incorrect. (can cause openSSH and certificate issues)
  A: Try resetting the system time and date to be local as it might have stopped for whatever reason and is out of date.
  You will need to use the command 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' . If the package dpkg-reconfigure is not found you will need 
  download it first. Type 'sudo apt-get install debconf' then the above command.
  
  If that doesn't fix the time, follow the instructions on this page:
